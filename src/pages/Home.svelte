                Hi! My name is Elie Diaz. I'm currently a PhD student at the
                University of Utah, working on Computer Graphics. My first two
                degrees (BS and MS) were from Georgia Tech in Computer Science,
                so I have been learning more about the field for a few years
                now. As far as my projects are concerned, I have done a decent
                amount of work in simulation. Go ahead and explore my site to
                learn more about me!
            </div>
            <!-- <div class="block is-size-7">
                I've also built up experience teaching! During my undergrad and
                master's, I was a TA for Georgia Tech's undergrad Computer
                Graphics course (CS 3451), under various faculty at Tech. After
                about 4 years of being a TA, I was awarded the College of
                Computing's "Outstanding Undergraduate TA" Award.

            <!-- <div class="block is-size-7">
                My other projects are especially focused on music, as you can
                see on the other tabs. Throughout my years in ensembles, I've
                built up a music resume that includes performances with Piano
                and Voice as well as experience directing and arranging music
                for small ensembles. I'm an especially big fan of Barbershop
                Quartet Singing, having been a member of the Barbershop Harmony
                Society on and off since high school.

            <div class="block has-text-justified is-size-7">
                I built this site using Svelte and Bulma as frameworks. With
                these, I was able to split the site into several tabs. You'll
                find that project tab useful if you're interested in finding a
                general overlook of the Computer Graphics projects I've worked
                on and am working on. Another large part of my life revolves
                around music, so you can go to that tab to check out the various
                music-related projects I'm able to share. Finally, that last CV tab
                should take you to a link to download a pdf of my most recent
                version of my CV.
