        On top of all of my academic work, I dedicate a lot of my time towards
        writing and performing music. My background here mostly stems down to

                    meant to be performed with the Georgia Tech Chamber Choir
                    but delays due to the 2020 pandemic led me to call some of
                    my friends to record it across the country from Florida,
                    Idaho, and Georgia.

                    performed in various groups through the years, I wanted to
